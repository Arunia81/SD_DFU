# Steam Deck Daggerfall Unity install script
This is a script I made to download and install Daggerfall Unity and the game data files onto your Steamdeck.

This will use the Linux version of the Unity mod and is used through the non-Steam game option.
The files will be directly download from the github page for Unity and the google drive for the game data files zip.

This is also my first time doing this and also the first time using Github for sharing something.

My standard download location is /home/deck/Desktop/temp.
The game will be extracted/installed to /home/deck/games/DFU

I will try to maintain and update the script when problems arise, which includes download location or updates of the different files.
